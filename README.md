# Survey form with React

The aim of project was to learn how implement "useState"-hooks and use form fields in React, as well as how to connect HTML form input to state. I made a survey imitating a cinema check out experience, asking the user to pick movie, seats, dates and snacks. 


I enjoyed working and learning about "useState"-hooks, and would like to challenge myself to use more conditional renderings in future projects.
